Even if different users receive free gift cards with different exchange codes, only one can be exchanged. Custom gift cards are not subject to this restriction.",

Before the user exchanges the gift card, if there is no 'inviter' (i.e. the invitation code has not been entered at the time of registering the account), it will be automatically associated with the first-level friend of the card issuer. If A does not enter an invitation code when registering an account, then A does not belong to any one's first or second-level friends, but when A is converted into B's first-level friends through the gift card issued by B, A automatically becomes B's first-level friends.",
